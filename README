This project supply a simple way to send html email in java,which uses spring.

There are two way to send email: synchronize and asynchronous. the second way need a JMS server,in this
project,I use active MQ,you can download it at here:http://activemq.apache.org/download.html

You can also add attachment in the email.there are also two ways:add a File object or a InputStream Object.
in asynchronous send email: you can add File Object or byte array Object(you can use apache commons
IOUtils.toByteArray to convert InputStream to byte array).
